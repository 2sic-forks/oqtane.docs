# Oqtane Docs

## Todo iJungleboy

1. Explain how to add images
1. 

## Todo - Discuss w/Shaun

1. Walk-through the documentation solution
1. Recommendation to hide all APIs unless marked as `[PublicApi]`
1. I would not include documentation for BlazorTheme or OqtaneTheme if that's ok
1. Inconsistencies like 
	1. `Models` contains models, and `Pages` also contains Models 
	1. `UI` also contains Enums, even though we have a namespace `Enums`
1. the namespace `UI` which should probably be `Ui`
