# Installation

### Using Version 2+:

* Install .NET 5 SDK (v5.0.100).

* Install the latest edition (v16.8 or higher) of Visual Studio 2019 (Community, Professional, or Enterprise Editions) with the ASP.NET and web development workload enabled. Oqtane works with ALL editions of Visual Studio from Community to Enterprise. If you do not have a SQL Server installation available already and you wish to use LocalDB for development, you must also install the .NET desktop development workload.

* Download a release or Clone the Oqtane source code to your local system. Open the Oqtane.sln solution file and Build the solution. Make sure you specify Oqtane.Server as the Startup Project and then Run the application.
